[INT. SPRINGFIELD NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - DAY]

[We see Homer SIMPSON sitting at his workstation in the control room, looking bored. MR. BURNS walks in, wearing his signature suit and top hat.]

C. Montgomery Burns: Ah, Simpson! How are things running today?

Homer Simpson: (excitedly) Oh, everything's just dandy, Mr. Burns! No meltdowns, no explosions, nothing to worry about!

C. Montgomery Burns: (suspiciously) Hmm, that's quite unusual for this plant. Are you sure everything is in order?

Homer Simpson: (nervously) Of course, Mr. Burns! I've been monitoring the reactor all day, and it's running like a well-oiled machine.

C. Montgomery Burns: (smirking) Well, I suppose I'll just have to take your word for it. But remember, one slip-up, and you'll be out on the street faster than you can say nuclear meltdown.

[Homer gulps nervously as MR. BURNS exits the control room. Suddenly, the lights flicker, and an alarm starts blaring.]

Homer Simpson: (panicking) Oh no, not again!

[We see LISA SIMPSON and BART SIMPSON walking by outside the control room.]

Lisa Simpson: (sarcastically) Looks like Dad's up to his usual antics.

Bart Simpson: (grinning) This is gonna be epic!

[Homer frantically tries to fix the problem, pressing buttons and pulling levers. Smoke starts billowing out of the control panel.]

Homer Simpson: (screaming) Marge, I'm sorry!

[MARGE SIMPSON rushes in, wearing a hazmat suit.]

Marge Simpson: Homer, what have you done this time?

Homer Simpson: (sheepishly) I may have, uh, accidentally caused a minor nuclear incident.

Marge Simpson: (rolling her eyes) Well, let me handle this.

[MARGE deftly fixes the problem, and the alarms stop blaring. The smoke clears, and everything returns to normal.]

Marge Simpson: (smiling) There, crisis averted. Again.

Homer Simpson: (hugging MARGE) Oh, Marge, you're my hero!

[BART and LISA high-five each other outside the control room.]

Bart Simpson: (jokingly) And they say our family isn't nuclear-powered.

Lisa Simpson: (laughing) Classic Simpsons chaos.

[The scene fades out as the Simpsons embrace each other in the control room, happy and relieved.]
